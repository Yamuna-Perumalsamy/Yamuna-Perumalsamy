- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yamuna-Perumalsamy.

-    I love to see stuff grow - be it me, plants, dogs or applications, lol. 
- 👀 In my current job, I mostly work with Java and Spring Boot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Strucures and algos, and filling in some gaps on my tech stack.
- 💞️ I’m looking to contribute to some open source projects this year and do some freelancing to help my friends with their business.
